- You could consider to just describe only one direction and then mention somewhere that withdraw back to parent is done exactly the same way (but not sure if its better that way)

- I prefer the term Sidechain Federation Gateways 

- We need to understand better the PayToContract scheme, I don't understand it but maybe its very beneficial

- So there is only one sidechain gateway P2SH addresses? address reuse will be massive but I guess coming up with another scheme is problematic.

- Deterministic master is interesting, I dont think however that having all sidechain gateways connected to each other is such a big overhead, we could create a gateway mempool that collects withdraws and each node that agrees signs and circulates the signed trx so eventually the trx will be sufficiently signed and one of the gateways broadcast it (I think there will be up to 20 gateways) we can use a new payload message for that

- The exact exchange rate is determined at the start of the sidechain and can not be changed ever, its important to clarify that. 

- "Note also that the federation may elect to disallow withdrawals entirely at their own discretion" absolutely not (why would you want that?), and the federation must be diverse enough that people can trust that will never be the case

- The comments about ICO don't make sense, the whole point is to raise funds on parent and use them, ICO in general have nothing to do with sidechains unless its a sidechain that can issue tokens
- Whats appointment proofs?

- I dont think the first federation member should be appointing the next one this should be know from start (or voted on as you suggested)  we should also consider a requirement that a gateway has to lock a certain amount of coins

- "Loss of side chain material can be recovered from by recreating the entire chain with new federation keys" I dont think thats true
